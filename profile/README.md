# Welcome to The Beyond Group

The Beyond Group is a digital product studio focused on supporting e-commerce
merchants with Shopify. We are a team that integrates strategy, design, development, and data.

We work with brands who have found their market and are looking go grow!

## Open Source

To support our work, we have created several open source packages:

- [Shopkeeper](https://github.com/TheBeyondGroup/shopkeeper) - a tool to manage Shopify theme settings
- [Shopify Richtext Renderer](https://github.com/TheBeyondGroup/shopify-rich-text-renderer) - a package to render the data from richtext fields into an HTML string.
- [Liquid Syntax Highlighting for Zed](https://github.com/TheBeyondGroup/zed-shopify-liquid) - a Zed extension to add syntax highlighting for the [Zed](https://zed.dev) editor.
